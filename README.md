# `Team_Rwanda_facial_Recognition_AI`

### Continuous Authentication Solution
The solution uses AI-based continuous authentication to confirm that the person taking the exam on the device remains the same throughout the entire duration. This method is essential to avoid cheating or unauthorized handovers.

### How it Works:
The camera captures the userâ€™s image at the start of the exam session.
Images are stored securely within an ICP canister for periodic comparison working with endpoints.
The AI system takes an image every ten seconds, analyzing it against the initially stored image.
If the user leaves the device or if another person appears, the system detects the difference and issues an alert, terminating the session.

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd face-detection-AI-ON-ICP/


## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
 dfx start --clean --background 
# Install npm

npm install

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.


# Instructions for Use
### Sign Up and Login:

Users register by creating an account with an email and password on the decentralized AI system.
After registration, users can log in to access the camera and image capture features.
### Start Camera:

Users click Start Camera to activate their front-facing camera, positioning themselves in view.
### Capture Image:

Click Capture Image to take a picture, and then Upload to store the image in a canister for ongoing authentication.
### Start Managed Session:

Once the image is uploaded, users click Start Managed Session to initiate the AI-powered continuous monitoring session.
The system will check every ten seconds to ensure the user remains the same.
### System Alerts:

If an anomaly is detected (i.e., a different person appears in front of the camera), an alert is issued, and the user is logged out immediately to maintain the integrity of the exam session.


### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
